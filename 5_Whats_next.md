### How do I keep learning?

A good way to keep your momentum is to choose a project or goal.
	* Try your hand at your next school project with coding
	* Break the problem into small pieces and tackle them bit by bit.

### Suggestions for Projects

1. Make a website with [Github and Hugo](https://gohugo.io). [Check out the page I made!](https://alburycatalina.github.io/me/)
2. Collect some data from around you (make a survey or download some from the internet) and [plot it in an interesting way](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com). 
3. Use R for your next school assignment. Use coding to make the process faster or go above and beyond. Make a cool PDF slick graphs and text in [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com).
4. Learn to collect data from websites with the [revest package](https://blog.rstudio.com/2014/11/24/rvest-easy-web-scraping-with-r/). Make your computer text you the weather every morning or get automatic updates from your favorite sports team.
