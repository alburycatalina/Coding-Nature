# Coding Nature

![Coding Nature Poster](https://github.com/alburycatalina/Coding-Nature/blob/main/images/codingnature.png)


## We will cover:

+ What coding is
+ How you can use it as a tool to understand the world around you
+ How to install a frequently-used language (R) and IDE (interactive development environment) onto your machine 
+ Some examples of programming commands and logic
+ "Tidy" data - how scientists collect and organize information
+ What’s next?


This lesson is adapted from [Data Carpentry’s Intro to R for Ecologists](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/) and uses data from the [US National Park Services](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/gisandmapping/tools-and-data.htm). 



# What is Coding? Why do scientists use it?

Programming provides us with a direct line of communication to our technology. Most of the time when we interact with technology, we use *interfaces* which are designed to make tasks easy to complete. For example, checking your email, posting a photo to instagram, or using the self checkout at the grocery store. All of these programns and apps rely on their underlying code, developed by programmers to tell them "what to do." Programming is everywhere and it's also an invaluable skill to have when [entering the job market](https://www.fastcompany.com/3060883/why-coding-is-the-job-skill-of-the-future-for-everyone). 

What if you want to use your computer for something that someone's never done before? You need to create the code to accomplish that goal! A scientists' main goal is to ask questions about the world and collect *observations* to provide evidence that supports their hypotheses (or don't). Programming can be a tool for collecting and understanding the observations they collect. 



# Getting started

 Use this page to follow along as you set up your machine for the workshop. We’ll be using the “sticky method” to make sure you and I are on the same page. We’ll work through the lesson in chunks. Once you’re finished the current task, you can put a thumbs up in the chat. You can send a thumbs down if you're stuck and need help.
 
 
 ## Setting Up
 
1. Start downloading the latest version of R [here](https://cloud.r-project.org). Under "download and install R" select "Download R for (Mac) OS X" or "Download R for Windows".

  ![Download R](https://github.com/alburycatalina/Coding-Nature/blob/main/images/download_r.png)

Select the latest release and follow the instructions to install.

  ![Install R](https://github.com/alburycatalina/Coding-Nature/blob/main/images/download_r2.png)

2. Download the Rstudio IDE [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). Select the free version.

3. Make sure they work before the tutorial by opening up Rstudio. 

4. Put up a thumbs down if you're having trouble.
