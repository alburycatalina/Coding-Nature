![Coding Nature Poster](https://github.com/alburycatalina/Coding-Nature/blob/main/images/codingnature.png)


## We will cover:

+ What coding is
+ How you can use it as a tool to understand the world around you
+ How to install a frequently-used language (R) and IDE (interactive development environment) onto your machine 
+ Some examples of programming commands and logic
+ "Tidy" data - how scientists collect and organize information
+ Working with packages
+ Data visualization
+ What’s next?

This lesson is adapted from [Data Carpentry’s Intro to R for Ecologists](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/) and uses publicly available data from the [US National Park Services](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/gisandmapping/tools-and-data.htm). 

We have the spectacular team at [O.N.E](https://www.onenorthend.ca/), particularly Rodney Small and LaMeia Reddick, to thank for making this workshop possible. 


# What is Coding? Why do scientists use it?

Programming provides us with a direct line of communication to our technology. Most of the time when we interact with technology, we use *interfaces* which are designed to make tasks easy to complete. You utilize these interfaces when you check your email, post a photo to instagram, or use the self-checkout at the grocery store. All of these programs and apps rely on their underlying code, developed by programmers like you, to tell them "what to do." Clearly, programming is everywhere. It's also an invaluable skill to have when [entering the job market](https://www.fastcompany.com/3060883/why-coding-is-the-job-skill-of-the-future-for-everyone). 

What if you want to use your computer for something that someone's never done before? In these cases, we need to *create* code that can accomplish that goal! A scientists' main goal is to ask questions about the world and collect *observations* to provide evidence that supports their hypotheses (or don't). Programming can be a tool for collecting and understanding the observations they collect. 



# Getting started

 Use this page to follow along as you set up your machine for the workshop. We’ll be using the “sticky method” to make sure you and I are on the same page. We’ll work through the lesson in chunks. Once you’re finished the current task, you can put a thumbs up in the chat. You can send a thumbs down if you're stuck and need help.
 
 
 ## Setting Up
 
1. Start downloading the latest version of R [here](https://cloud.r-project.org). Under "download and install R" select "Download R for (Mac) OS X" or "Download R for Windows".

  ![Download R](https://github.com/alburycatalina/Coding-Nature/blob/main/images/download_r.png)

Select the latest release and follow the instructions to install.

  ![Install R](https://github.com/alburycatalina/Coding-Nature/blob/main/images/download_r2.png)

2. Download the Rstudio IDE [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). Select the free version.

3. Make sure they work before the tutorial by opening up Rstudio. 

4. Put up a thumbs down if you're having trouble.
