# Coding Nature
A for a workshop for Black high school students in Nova Scotia. This workshop aims to inspire passion for nature and science, while teaching some basic coding logic. This workshop will demonstrate how we can use programming as a tool to help us better understand our environment.


## We will cover:

+ What coding is
+ How you can use it as a tool to understand the world around you
+ How to install a frequently-used language (R) and IDE (interactive development environment) onto your machine 
+ Some examples of programming commands and logic
+ "Tidy" data - how scientists collect and organize information
+ What’s next?


This lesson is adapted from Data Carpentry’s Intro to R for Ecologists. 



# What is Coding? Why do scientists use it?

Programming gives a direct line to our computers. Most of the time when we interact with technology, we use *interfaces* which are designed to make tasks easy to complete. For example, checking your email, posting a photo to instagram, or using the self checkout at the grocery store. All of these programns and apps rely on their underlyig code, developed by programmers to tell them "what to do."

What if you want to use your computer for something that someone's never done before? You need to create the code to accomplish that goal! A scientists' main goal is to ask questions about the world and collect *observations* to provide evidence that supports their hypotheses (or don't). Programming can be a tool for collecting and understanding the observations they collect. 


# Getting started

 Use this page to follow along as you set up your machine for the workshop. We’ll be using the “sticky method” to make sure you and I are on the same page. We’ll work through the lesson in chunks. Put a blue sticky note on your computer if you’re finished the current task. Put a pink sticky note up if you need help. If we're virtually meeting, you can put a thumbs up in the chat when you've completed the task or a thumbs down if you're stuck. 
 
 
 ## Setting Up
 
1. Start downloading the latest version of R [here](https://cloud.r-project.org). Under "download and install R" select "Download R for (Mac) OS X" or "Download R for Windows".

3. Make sure they work before the tutorial by opening up Rstudio. 

4. Put up a pink sticky or a thumbs down if you're having trouble.
